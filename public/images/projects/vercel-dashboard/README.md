# Dashboard Screenshots

## Required Images

This folder should contain the following screenshots from the Vercel Support Dashboard:

1. **cover.png** - Main dashboard hero image (1920x1080)
2. **inbox.png** - Inbox/ticket list view
3. **messaging.png** - Ticket detail with messaging
4. **admin.png** - Admin panel
5. **analytics.png** - Analytics dashboard

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Run the Vercel Support Dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd ../../../../../vercel-support-dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit http://localhost:3000

3. Take screenshots of each page

4. Save them in this folder with the names above

## Temporary Solution

Until you add real screenshots, the portfolio will show gradient backgrounds as fallbacks.
